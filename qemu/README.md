# My utilities related with QEMU

## Files

   * `mount-raw-disk-whole.pl`: 
   Mount a whole raw disk image to separate subdirectories. 
   It may usually be a disk image from you dump, e.g. 
   `dd if=/dev/sda of=my.img`.
   * `qemu-mount-disk-image.sh`: 
   It mounts the partition from a disk image created by QEMU.
   * `usecases`: 
   Do not recommend you use those files (or even look at them...). 
   They are just my experimental commands to load different environments using QEMU. 
   They only have local meaning on my system. 
   Nevertheless, they provide a reference for typical commands.
